brew install hadolint

Very Important: 
1) remove the "f" in app.py line 23 , so the make lint pass with no errors
2) edit the docker file , run section to be as follow 
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip &&\
   pip install --no-cache-dir requirements.txt
the below two commands are not necessary
PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/hadolint/2.3.0/bin:$PATH" ( not a must)
echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/hadolint/2.3.0/bin:$PATH"' >>~/.bash_profile
